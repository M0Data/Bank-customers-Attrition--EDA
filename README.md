# Bank Customer Attrition Analysis  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

This project analyzes a 10,000-record banking dataset to identify key drivers of customer churn and uncover actionable insights that support better retention strategies.

## Project Overview  
- Analyze customer demographics, credit scores, account balances, and product usage.  
- Identify behavioral patterns associated with customer attrition.  
- Provide insights that help financial institutions reduce churn and retain valuable customers.

- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and standardized data types.  
- Encoded categorical features for analysis.  
- Ensured a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  
- Visualized key churn indicators including credit score, age, balance, and product usage.  
- Performed correlation analysis to highlight high-impact features.

---

## Key Insights  
- Customers with **zero balance** showed high churn likelihood.  
- **Low credit score** was strongly associated with attrition.  
- Older customers and those with low product engagement were more likely to leave.  
- These insights can guide targeted retention, upsell strategies, and product engagement improvements.
